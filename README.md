This is a game where the user moves the paddle left or right to bounce the ball in an attempt to hit the bricks above. Points are then accumulated for each brick destroyed. The goal of the game is to destroy all bricks before your lives run out. This game was written in HTML and JavaScript, utilizing the HTML canvas element. The game exists within the canvas where all the materials are drawn, and the movement of the paddle and ball is visible. The recognizable features of the game involves the score and the 3 lives given to the user. The most challenging portion of creating this game is checking if the ball collides with another object.
